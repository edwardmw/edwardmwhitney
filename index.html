	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Edward Whitney</span> and I study the economics of development.</p>

	<p>I spend most of my time as a <span itemprop="title">PhD student</span> in the Agricultural and Resource Economics program at  <a href="https://are.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">UC Davis</a>. Before returning to school, I worked for three years at the <a href="https://www.ifpri.org/" target="_blank">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> as a research analyst, focusing mostly on poverty analysis in Pakistan. I have a master's degree in International Development from <a href="https://www.american.edu/" target="_blank">American University</a> and a bachelor's degree in Economics from the <a href="https://www.utah.edu/" target="_blank">University of Utah</a>.</p>
	
	<p>When I'm not occupied with coursework, I like to explore new-to-me corners of the world and think about urban/rural linkages and global futurities.</p>

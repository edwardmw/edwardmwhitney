            <p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Edward Whitney</span> and I study the economics of development and natural resource managment.</p>                
			
			<p>In my job market paper (under submission) titled "<i>Ancillary Consequences of Targeted Policy Interventions in the Presence of Disease-Based Poverty Traps: Evidence from Uganda</i>", my co-authors and I develop a coupled natural-human system model of a local economy integrated with ecological and disease dynamics, which we use to investigate the direct and ancillary consequences of targeted policy interventions in a rural, developing-country setting where household livelihoods are deeply linked to health and the environment. Our results demonstrate that targeted policy interventions can produce both intuitive and counterintuitive consequences. Productivity-enhancing
            interventions can produce economic, ecological, and public health benefits, while interventions that target ecological objectives may inadvertently prop up conditions that underlie disease-based poverty traps. I'm excited to connect with other researchers on these subjects; if your research overlaps, feel free to <a href="http://edwardmwhitney.com/contact" target="_blank">contact me</a>.  </p>
            
			<p>I am a recent <span itemprop="title">PhD graduate</span> from the Agricultural and Resource Economics program at  <a href="https://are.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">UC Davis</a>.<!-- My research focuses on public health and natural resource management in developing countries.-->
            Before returning to school, I worked for three years at the <a href="https://www.ifpri.org/" target="_blank">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> as a research analyst, focusing mostly on poverty analysis in Pakistan. I have a master's degree in International Development from <a href="https://www.american.edu/" target="_blank">American University</a> and a bachelor's degree in Economics from the <a href="https://www.utah.edu/" target="_blank">University of Utah</a>.</p>

	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Edward Whitney</span> and I study the economics of development.</p>

	<p>I spend most of my time as a <span itemprop="title">PhD student</span> in the Agricultural and Resource Economics program at  <a href="https://are.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">UC Davis</a>. Before returning to school, I worked for three years at the <a href="https://www.ifpri.org/" target="_blank">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> as a research analyst, focusing mostly on poverty analysis in Pakistan. I have a master's degree in International Development from <a href="https://www.american.edu/" target="_blank">American University</a> and a bachelor's degree in Economics from the <a href="https://www.utah.edu/" target="_blank">University of Utah</a>.</p>
	
	<p>I focus on health and natural resources in developing countries. In my dissertation proposal (coming soon!), I explore the relationships between labor productivity and Schistosomiasis, an environmentally transmitted parasitic disease, among fishing communities on an island in Lake Victoria, Uganda. I'm exicted to connect with other researchers on these topics and welcome you to reach out to me with anything you'd like to share on this topic. </p>

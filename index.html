		<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Edward Whitney</span> and I study the economics of development and natural resource managment.</p>

		<p>I am a recent <span itemprop="title">PhD graduate</span> from the Agricultural and Resource Economics program at  <a href="https://are.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">UC Davis</a>. Before returning to school, I worked for three years at the <a href="https://www.ifpri.org/" target="_blank">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> as a research analyst, focusing mostly on poverty analysis in Pakistan. I have a master's degree in International Development from <a href="https://www.american.edu/" target="_blank">American University</a> and a bachelor's degree in Economics from the <a href="https://www.utah.edu/" target="_blank">University of Utah</a>.</p>
	
		<p>I focus on public health and natural resource management in developing countries. 
			In my <a  href="jmp/jmp_intro.pdf" target = _blank>job market paper</a>, I use a case study of Schistosomiasis in Uganda to explore the potential for economic policy to contribute to disease management. 
			I'm excited to connect with other researchers on these subjects, so if your research overlaps feel free to <a href="http://edwardmwhitney.com/contact" target="_blank">contact me</a>.  </p>

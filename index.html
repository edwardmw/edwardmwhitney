	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Edward Whitney</span> and I study the economics of development.</p>

	<p>I spend most of my time as a <span itemprop="title">PhD student</span> in the Agricultural Resource Economics program at  <a href="https://are.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis</a>. Before returning to school, I worked for three years at <a href="https://ifpri.org/">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> as a research analyst, focusing on poverty analysis in Pakistan. I got to help out with the design and training of household surveys, as well as the gritty process of getting the data ready for analysis. </p>
	
	<p>When I'm not occupied with coursework, I like to explore new-to-me corners of the world and think about what societies will look like in the future.</p>
